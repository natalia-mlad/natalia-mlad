### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a researcher and data scientist with a background in Psychometrics. I have several years of experience in the FinTech industry, and I'm currently finishing my PhD on alternative data for micro-loan credit scoring. 

R is my go-to programming language, but I'm also proficient with Python.

Most of my repos are private, but I'm always open to sharing my work and collaborating on projects. Feel free to reach out to me if you're interested in working together or just want to chat about data science and psychometrics.
